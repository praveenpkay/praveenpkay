### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for checking out my Repository! 

Here are my Projects:
1. OPEN-AI Based Review Intelligence [here](https://github.com/praveenpkay/OpenAI-Driven-Review-Intelligence-In-Beauty-Industry)
Every year, the consumer product goods industry witnesses the introduction of around 30,000 new products, yet less than 10% of them manage to achieve true success, as revealed by the McKinsey Consumer Trend Study in 2019. Understanding customers precisely and timely for product development becomes one of the key strengths of consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies.

This project's primary objective is to establish a big-data-driven review intelligence and sentiment analysis pipeline, harnessing the capabilities of OpenAI, specifically tailored for the beauty industry. By leveraging LLM, we are able to think naturally again, effortlessly grasping the key information hidden in the data and conveying the business insights efficiently.
